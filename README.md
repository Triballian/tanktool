# tanktool
Allows diep players to automate console commands in diep to optimize for each specific tank the player uses.
Starting code I pulled from go playground https://play.golang.org/p/osbinz7DmN .

Current issue, if you run the program and before shutting it down run it again, it will not work.
ToDo:
    I will need to make it detect if the program is already running. If it is do not run it again.
    This should keep you from running the program more than once at any time.

    Have the program running in the background perhaps available in windows system tray.
